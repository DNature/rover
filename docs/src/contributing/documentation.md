# Documentation

Documentation for using and contributing to the Apollo CLI tool is built using
[`mdbook`].

To contribute to the documentation you can edit the markdown source files in the
`docs/src` directory.

To build and view the documentation you'll need to install and run `mdbook`:

```
cargo install mdbook
```

then

```
cd docs/ && mdbook serve
```
