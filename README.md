This is the home of the new CLI for Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools.

This repo is organized as a [`cargo` workspace], containing two related projects:

- `rover`: a CLI that wraps `apollo` 
- `apollo`: a library containing functionality to interact with graphs and Apollo services
